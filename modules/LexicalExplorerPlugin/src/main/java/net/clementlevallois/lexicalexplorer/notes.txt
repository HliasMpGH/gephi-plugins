When the user selects the attribute they want to analyze:

- the tokenizer should run on the textual values of this attribute for each node

- the tokens should be stored in a particular way:

-> the list of tokens for each node should be stored separately, in a MAP

MAP <NODE, LIST OF TOKENS FOR THIS NODE>

When the selection changes AND IF the last refresh happened more than a second ago,
    - we retrieve from the selection manager the list of the nodes being currently selected
    - with this list, we query the map and retrieve the lists of tokens for all the selected nodes
    - we sort this tokens from the most frequent to the least frequent and pick the 10 most frequent terms
    - and we show these terms in the plugin!

ELSE, DO NOTHING

THAT'S IT!!
