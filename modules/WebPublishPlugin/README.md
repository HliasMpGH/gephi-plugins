# Gephi Plugin: Publish to the web

This is a work initiated during the Gephi Code Retreat (Aug 29 to Sept 2, 2022). The plugin will allow users to:

- export a gexf file directly from the Gephi desktop app, to the web
- the exported gexf file gets hosted on the web and users get a url that allows them to explore it directly or share the url

## Types of export

At the moment: Retina only: https://ouestware.gitlab.io/retina/beta

Hosting: through a gist 

## Progress so far
The plugin is functional and its interface is available in all languages that Gephi supports.
The plugin is going to be reviewed (quality checks...) before it can be released and made available.
